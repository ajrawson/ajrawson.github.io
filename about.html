<p>I am a .net software developer, currently employed with INTL FCStone as the Manager of Client Onboarding Systems, 
working on creating MVC applications for complex financials markets. Along with the MVC 
framework I am also working with Entity Framework and jQuery to convert web pages to .net. 
Along with my work as a Web Developer I recently completed the Professional and 
Managers MBA program at the University of Iowa.</p>

<p>I am the former vice president and president, of the Cedar Valley .net user group, 
www.cvineta.com. I really enjoy spending time with other developers to help myself grow and 
help others improve their craft. </p>

<p>In my spare time I like to play my guitar, ride my bike, snow ski, and play as much golf as I can.</p>
