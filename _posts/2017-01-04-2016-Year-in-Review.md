Normally I wouldn't do a review of the previous year, but I had some pretty big things happen professionally and personally in 2016.  I'll start with the personal items as the family wouldn't let me live it down if i didn't. 

####  __The Family Grew by One__ 

My wife and I welcomed an addition to our family in April, Jack Charles came screaming into the world and hasn't looked back.  Parenthood has been an amazing experience and pushed me in ways I would've never thought.  Out little guy is pretty awesome and I just want to do everything I can to give him the best life possible (as cliche as that sounds).  I just wish he would let me sleep more, I'm hoping Jack is setting 2017 goals and include walking, talking and letting his parents sleep.  I'm really looking forward to watching Jack grow in 2017 and what adventures he'll be taking my wife and I on.

#### __I Completed my MBA__ 

Getting a masters degree was always something I had thought about, and back in 2008 I decided I was ready to start working towards that goal.  I studied and took the GMAT that year and then life happened and I delayed the start of my first class until 2010.  I only took a class or two the first couple years as I was trying to decide if this was something I really wanted to do personally and financially.  

Then in the fall of 2012 I decided I was going to take the plunge and make the full commitment to getting my MBA.  It took until January of 2016 of  but I can now officially say I have a Masters degree.  

There were times I questioned why I was doing all this school work will also holding down a full time job.  But looking back, the process of getting my MBA will go down as one of the bigger highlights and prouder moments of my life.

If you have that the internal drive to get your MBA, I would encourage you to chase those dreams.  I don't think you'll regret it!

#### __Took New Role as Manager and Product Owner__ 

With the completion of my MBA a promotion came shortly after.  This is something I'd been working towards for a few years and had been taking on more and more leadership roles within my team.  In March I was finally promoted and assigned a couple developers and given the opportunity to hire a third.  The team works on the application that I helped build the previous three years which I am now the product owner over.  

Over the course of the year I've helped the team transition to scrum and also implemented a number of operational improvements to help the developers improve their day to day output.  The team seems to be starting to click now and with the addition of a tester, scrum master, and BA we are really starting to move through the backlog.

I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous about the job change, but I've really enjoyed the move to management and from early reports I'm doing pretty well.  I still have a lot to learn but thankfully I have some of the most forgiving people working around me, they'll laugh at my mistakes but are also willing to give me another chance.  

I hope 2017 brings more improvements for our team and continued success.

#### __Traveled__ 

I traveled a lot this year for work and MBA related reasons and got to see places I've never been to before.  

For the last class of my MBA I traveled to Hong Kong and South China.  The trip was amazing and the opportunity to meet executives and hear them speak to our MBA class was a once in a lifetime opportunity.  I also get to meet some amazing people and created some great new friendships from that trip.  I was also lucky enough to get to spend a few extra days in Hong Kong for work and spent time with some coworkers I'd never met.  My Hond Kong coworkers made sure to show me the true parts of Hong Kong which was an awesome treat.

I did a bit more traveling for work this year than I have in the past and got to see some new places.  I took 2 trips to Alabama and knocked that state off my list.  While in Alabama I enjoyed some good food and southern hospitality at our office down there.  I got the chance to tour the [Chicago Board of Trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Board_of_Trade) in Chicago, don't skip the opportunity to experience the CBOT if you ever get the chance.  I got the opportunity to travel to our companies bi-annual Global Sales Meeting where we got to hear [Sugar Ray Leonard](http://sugarrayleonard.com/) speak as well as my of the executives from our company.  And finally spent some fun days and nights in Kansas City.

#### __My wife took up a career in IT__

The final highlight was not my own, but of seeing my wife make the career change into software testing.  This is something she has talked about for a few years and she had really done her homework on what a career in this field would look like.  I was really happy and proud of her for taking the steps she did to make this dream come true.  She's only been doing the job for half a year but she seems to love the change and seems happier when she's at home (Happy Wife, Happy Life).  

Here's to hoping 2017 has just as many good quality highlights!
