I recently gave a presentation at the Cedar Valley .net User Group meeting in Cedar Falls, Iowa. The presentation was a 100 level presentation on source control and how it works for most .net programmers, and how programmers could use branching to help them manage their source control and projects.

The presentation went well, it was the first time I’ve ever presented but I thought I did a fairly good job. I did learn that I need to really practice a presentation a few more times before I give a talk and to try to relax before I start. Not much quality criticism on the presentation which is a good and bad thing, personally I think I need to work on how I use terms and make sure I don’t confuse one term with another when I’m talking. I’ll admit it is a little tougher when you are talking about source control because you have quite a few words that contain source or control in them and can easily get tongue tied and use the wrong term. Hopefully I can present another presentation again sometime soon and continue to improve on my technical and programming knowledge, and to become a better public speaker.

Here is the info on the presentation:
