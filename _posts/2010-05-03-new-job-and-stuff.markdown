I know I haven’t blogged like I wanted to when I started this adventure, so I thought I’d explain what I’ve been doing for the past few months. First of all I started taking classes towards my MBA back in January and have been spending a lot of time on that. I recently just completed my first class and did well on that and will be taking a few months off before I take my next class. I’m really excited to be back in school and working towards my MBA and have already learned some valuable skills that I will be able to use in my job. Most of those skills I’ve learned relate more to management, but I hope to use those skills someday in the future. There are a few things I picked up that I will be able to use in my everyday work life that I’m excited to get the chance to use.

I have also started working for a new company and am working solely on web applications. My previous company developed applications in ASP.Net WebForms and Windows Forms applications and I was ready for a change that would allow me to spend a majority of my time on web development. Currently I am working on converting classic asp pages to ASP.Net MVC and also helping the company improve their development practices using source control, testing servers, continuous integration, and many other development practices to help improve the quality of code that is deployed for our customers use. I’m excited about the new challenges that this job presents and extremely excited to be focusing a majority of my development time on the web. I know I have a long ways to go before I can call myself a good web developer but hopefully I can learn these technologies quickly.

Hopefully I will be making some blog posts over the next few months on web technologies that I am learning and becoming more familiar with as I start this deeper dive into web development. I am also hoping that maybe I can find a good topic and dive into it enough to give a presentation or two on it. I really want to get better at public speaking and maybe this is the chance to do that.
