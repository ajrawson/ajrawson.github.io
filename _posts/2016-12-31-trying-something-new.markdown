Well the [tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) experiment didn't go well, as you can probably tell from the previous blog post's publish date.  With the encouragement awhile back from my friend @mikecole I've decided to give [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and its [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) integrations a try for a blogging site.  

I have nothing bad to say about tumblr, I was just never excited about having them host my blog and because of that I never felt like blogging.  I'm hoping with this move to Jeykll and github pages I'll find the spark to start blogging again.

A couple of the reasons why I think this change will be good is that it gives me a chance to be a geek and play with github.  I also like the idea of getting to learn [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), I'm having to document thoughts and ideas a lot more with my career change to Product Owner and Manager, I'm hoping markdown can become a tool I use to help with the documentation.  

So far my Jekyll experience has been mixed, I think a lot of that had to do with being on Windows.  I thought the documentation could've been better and I had to do a lot of hunting to find answers to questions, but I now know a lot more about the internals of Jekyll and the github integration.  It took me a bit, but I think I have the site up and running with the basics.  I have some things I want to change, but I can deal with those in the future.  We'll first see how this blogging experience goes before I start adding any new features to the site.

Here's to the future and hopefully some success on this Jekyll blogging experiment.
