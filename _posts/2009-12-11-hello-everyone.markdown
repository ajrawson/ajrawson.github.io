My name is Aaron and I wanted to start a blog to share my experiences with Software Development.  These blog posts are not only a record for myself to look back at but also hopefully can help other software developers with issues or problems that I have already come across.

I would like to also add that views I express on this website/weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer or its affiliates.

Also another warning you might find some personal blog posts from time to time and I just hope you enjoy them, if you don’t I’m sorry and I will try to keep them in good taste!
