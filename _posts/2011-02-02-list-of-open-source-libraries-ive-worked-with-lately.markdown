I’ve been wanting to make a list of open source projects I’ve been working with for some time, and decided today was the day.  Some of these libraries I’ve spent a lot of time with and know very well and some I’ve just been using for one purpose or another.  But without furher adieu here is the list:

.Net open source libraries
+ [AutoMapper](http://automapper.codeplex.com/)
+ [Elmah](https://code.google.com/p/elmah/)
+ [nUnit](http://www.nunit.org/)
+ [SquishIt](http://www.codethinked.com/SquishIt-The-Friendly-ASPNET-JavaScript-and-CSS-Squisher)
+ [StructureMap](http://docs.structuremap.net/)

Javascript open source libraries
+ [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
+ [jQuery-ui](http://jqueryui.com/)
+ [jQuery.validate](http://learn.jquery.com/Plugins/validation)
+ [jQuery.autocomplete](http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/)
+ [jQuery.ba-bbq](http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/)
+ [jQuery.cookie](http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie)
+ [jQuery.easing](http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/Easing)
+ [jQuery.galleryview](http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/galleryview)
+ [jQuery.hoverIntent](http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/hoverIntent)
+ [jQuery.maskedinput](http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/maskedinput)
+ [jQuery.metadata](http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/metadata)
+ [jQuery.timers](http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/timers)
+ [jQuery.tmpl](http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/)
+ [jMyCarousel](http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/jMyCarousel)
+ [lytebox](http://dolem.com/lytebox/)
+ [mbMenu](http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/mbMenu)

I’ll probably keep adding to this list as I start using more open source libraries and possibly make an additional list of items I’ve quit using as I grow in my development career.
