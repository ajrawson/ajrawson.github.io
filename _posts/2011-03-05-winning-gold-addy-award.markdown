Late last year, the designer I worked with ([Bill Pendry](http://www.billpendry.com/index.html) ) on the new [Martin Bros](https://www.martinbros.com/) website submitted our work to the [Cedar Valley’s](http://www.aafcedarvalley.com/addy-winners.asp) chapter of the American Advertising Federation for consideration of an Addy award.  In January we were notified that our hard work was being recognized with a Gold Addy Award.  So in mid February we went to the award ceremony in Waterloo and received our Gold Addy Award (pictured below), it was pretty cool seeing all the cool web apps and advertising stuff created in the last year on display.  I came away from the award ceremony truely impressed with the talent and skills of many of people who work with advertising and web promotions in the cedar valley area and feel really lucky and humbled to have been part of a team that won a Gold Addy Award.  It was also pretty cool to see some good friends and former coworkers get some recognition for their skills and hard work, so thank you to the CF-AAF for putting on a good show and helping recognize the hard work of so many people in the Cedar Falls/Waterloo area.

Also thank you to Martin Bros for allowing us to upgrade and try some new stuff with the corporate website that allowed us to receive this award.  Personally I’d like to thank my coworkers for helping get the site up and running especially Bill who did a ton of awesome design work and Kristin Clark who helped out with a few other important areas.

Now it’s time to go out and start working towards winning another Addy next year!
